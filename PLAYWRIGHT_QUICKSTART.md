# üöÄ Playwright Quick Start (Optional Upgrade)

Want to try Playwright before fully committing? Here's a 5-minute test.

## Step 1: Install (1 minute)

```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install chromium
```

That's it! No manual Chrome downloads, no version matching.

## Step 2: Test It (2 minutes)

Run the example scraper:

```bash
python3 examples/playwright_example.py
```

This will scrape Costco Travel and print prices, same as your current Selenium scraper.

## Step 3: Compare (2 minutes)

### Your Current Setup (.env requirements)
```bash
CHROME_BINARY_PATH="/Applications/chrome/mac_arm-141.0.7390.65/chrome-mac-arm64/Google Chrome for Testing.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome for Testing"
CHROMEDRIVER_PATH=/path/to/chromedriver
```

### Playwright (no config needed!)
```bash
# Nothing! It just works
```

## Did It Work?

### ‚úÖ If Playwright worked better:
Consider migrating. I can help you do a gradual migration:
1. Keep Selenium as backup
2. Migrate one function at a time
3. Test in parallel
4. Switch when confident

### ‚ùå If Playwright had issues:
Stick with Selenium. It's working for you now, no need to fix what isn't broken.

## Migration Checklist (If You Want It)

- [ ] `playwright_driver_setup.py` - New browser setup
- [ ] `playwright_price_extractor.py` - Extract prices with Playwright
- [ ] `playwright_main.py` - Main script using Playwright
- [ ] Test both versions side-by-side
- [ ] Compare results for accuracy
- [ ] Switch when confident
- [ ] Remove Selenium dependencies

## Need Help Migrating?

I can create a parallel implementation:
- Keep `main.py` (Selenium) working
- Create `main_playwright.py` (new version)
- You test both, choose the winner
- Zero risk migration!

Just ask and I'll set it up.

## Resources

- **Playwright Docs**: https://playwright.dev/python/
- **Examples folder**: `examples/playwright_example.py`
- **Comparison**: See `BROWSER_AUTOMATION_COMPARISON.md`

## Quick Comparison

| Task | Selenium (Current) | Playwright |
|------|-------------------|------------|
| Setup time | 15-30 min | 1 min |
| Browser updates | Manual pain | Auto-handled |
| Flakiness | Medium | Low |
| Stealth | Good (manual) | Better (built-in) |
| Code simplicity | Complex waits | Auto-waits |
| Python support | Native | Native |

## Bottom Line

**Try the example.** If it works well, migration is worth the 2 hours. If not, no harm done!

```bash
# One command to test
python3 examples/playwright_example.py
```

Then decide based on results. üéØ
